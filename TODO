1. Still doesn't build geos for some reason. Even when all enemies are destroyed and spring left running overnight

2. 'affordable' estimate is wrong - we should substract current builder's actual consumption.
    (but I can't find how to acquire this info for current builder)

3. walk over builders by tech level: tech2-tech1-commander. That will allow to quickier use better technologies.

4.
    for techup=false strategy set metal sharing to 70%/70%
    for techup=true  strategy set metal sharing to 95%/95%
    that will allow companion bots to tech-up quickier
    Here is how spring changes sharing limits:
        PackPacket* packet = new PackPacket(11, NETMSG_SETSHARE);
        *packet << myPlayerNum << myTeam << metalShareFraction << energyShareFraction;
        return PacketType(packet);

5. upgrade mexes
